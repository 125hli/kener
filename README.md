## What is Kener?

Kener is status page system built with Sveltekit and NodeJS. It does not try to replace the Datadogs and Atlassian of the world. It tries to help some who wants to come up with a status page that looks nice and minimum overhead, in a modern way.

It is carefully crafted to be easy to use and customize.

It comes with all the basic asks for a status page. It is open-source and free to use.

Kener name is derived from the word "Kene" which means "how is it going" in Assamese, then .ing because it was a cheaply available domain.
