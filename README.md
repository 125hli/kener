# Kener - Status Page System
Kener: Open-source Node.js status page tool, designed to make service monitoring and incident handling a breeze. It offers a sleek and user-friendly interface that simplifies tracking service outages and improves how we communicate during incidents. And the best part? Kener integrates seamlessly with GitHub, making incident management a team effortâ€”making it easier for us to track and fix issues together in a collaborative and friendly environment.

It uses files to store the data. Other adapters are coming soon

Kener is still under development. There might be bugs. Please report them and I will fix them
