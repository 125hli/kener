# Set up Alerts

Kener supports multiple alerting mechanisms. You can set up alerts in the `site.yaml` file.

## Supported Alerting Mechanisms

Currently, Kener supports the following alerting mechanisms:

-   Webhook
-   Discord
-   Slack

We are adding more alerting mechanisms in the future.

## Configure Alerts

In the `site.yaml` file, you can add the alerting mechanisms under the `alertingChannels` key. It accepts an array of objects.

```yaml
alertingChannels:
  - name: Awesome Webhook
  	type: "webhook"
	url: "https://webhook.site/e0b7f471-adae-4153-b81b-4f977f65ad4a"
	method: "POST"
	headers:
      Authorization: Bearer $SOME_TOKEN_FROM_ENV
  - name: My Discord Channel
  	type: "discord"
	url: "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/your-webhook-url"
  - name: Some Slack Channel
	type: slack
    url: https://hooks.slack.com/services/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
```

Please make sure `name` is present.

```json

	]
}
```

## Add Alerts to Monitors

Once you have set up the alerts, you can add them to your monitors in the `config/monitors.yaml` file.

```yaml
- name: OkBookmarks
  tag: "okbookmarks"
  image: "https://okbookmarks.com/assets/img/extension_icon128.png"
  api:
      method: GET
      url: https://okbookmarks.com
  alerting:
      DOWN:
          failureThreshold: 1
          successThreshold: 1
          createIncident: true
          description: "ðŸš¨ **Service Alert**. This is a custom message"
          alertingChannels:
              - Awesome Webhook
              - My Discord Channel
              - Some Slack Channel
```

The `alerting` object lets you define the alerting mechanism for the monitor. It can do alerting for `DOWN` or `DEGRADED` status. You can add both or one of them.

-   `failureThreshold`: Number of consecutive failures before alerting
-   `successThreshold`: Number of consecutive successes before resolving the alert
-   `createIncident`: If set to `true`, Kener will create an incident that will be shown on the status page
-   `description`: Custom message for the alert
-   `alertingChannels`: Array of alerting channels to send the alert to
